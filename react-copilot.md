# [My Journey with GitHub Copilot: A Non-Developer’s Perspective](https://github.com/PetrusHandoko/react-sample/blob/main/EXPERIENCE_WITH_COPILOT.md)

> 🧠 *Can GitHub Copilot really help non-developers build real-world applications?*  
> This write-up documents my personal experiment using **GitHub Copilot** and **Visual Studio Code** to enhance a classic React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial.  
> As someone without a formal programming background, I wanted to see how far AI tools could take me — from learning React basics to expanding the game into an **NxN grid version** with smarter AI logic.  
> Below, I share what worked, what didn’t, and how the experience compared to building with ChatGPT alone.

## Learning React: The Starting Point

A while back, I decided to learn [React](https://react.dev/). To get started, I followed the official React tutorial to build a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game:  
🔗 [React Tutorial – Tic Tac Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

From the original sample, I expanded the project by adding new features such as:
- Playing against the computer  
- Smarter move logic (beyond random choices)

Once the project was complete, I used ChatGPT to recreate the same code for comparison.

## Exploring Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot

This time, I wanted to explore **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** with **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)** to see how well it could assist a *non-developer* in building an upgraded version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game — one that supports **NxN grids**.

**My setup:**
- Platform: Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot  
- Starting point on GitHub:  
  🔗 [Initial Code Reference](https://github.com/PetrusHandoko/react-sample/tree/edfed6f32333e90373f40137c5c520f36d964788)  
- GitHub Copilot Model: Claude Sonnet 3.5 (0.9x)

---

## Development Goals

My main objective was to:
- Expand the original game to support variable **NxN** grids  
- Refactor the code to align with **React best practices**  

I didn’t focus on analyzing the generated code — only on verifying that the results worked correctly in the browser.  
I made commits at each meaningful milestone.

## Results & Observations

GitHub Copilot performed **exceptionally well** in generating useful and functional code.  
However, I eventually hit the usage limit and received this message:

> “You’ve reached your monthly chat messages quota. Upgrade to Copilot Pro (30-day free trial) or wait for your allowance to renew.”

I plan to enhance the NxN version further, incorporating improvements suggested by Copilot.  
Once my access resets (or if I find an alternative tool), I’ll continue adding AI-driven features — like a computer player that performs as intelligently as my original version.

## Side Note

When posting this write-up, I noticed the **“Rewrite with AI”** option on GitHub — unfortunately, it’s only available to paid members.  
I also tried asking Copilot to rewrite this text, but its version leaned heavily toward **self-promotion**.  
Interestingly, I also asked Copilot to review my GitHub history for insights.
