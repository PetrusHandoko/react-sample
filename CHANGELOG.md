## CSS Implementation Details

### Grid Line Solution
```css

  display: inline-block;
  background: #666;
  padding: 2px;
}

.board-row {
  display: flex;
  gap: 2px;
  margin-bottom: 2px;
}

.square {
  background: #fff;
  border: none;
  /* Other square styles */
}
```

### Spacing Implementation
```css
.game-controls {
  margin-bottom: 2px;
  text-align: center;
}

.status {
  margin-bottom: 2px;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

### Button Styling
```css
.reset-button {
  margin-top: 15px;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  font-size: 16px;
  cursor: pointer;
  background: #fff;
  border: 2px solid #666;
  border-radius: 4px;
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
}
```

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding animation for game moves
- Implement win line highlighting
- Add game history/undo functionality
- Consider adding sound effects for moves and wins

These changes have resulted in a more polished and consistent user interface across both game variants, with improved usability and visual appeal.
