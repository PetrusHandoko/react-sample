## Documentation Requests

### Initial Project History Request

**User**: Please provide the changes from the beginning, not just this conversation. I lost the previous chat records. The history of the changes start from original game development, then ChatGPT helped to build classic version, then you started creating a new NxN game. After all 3 games were built, you helped to structure the code to follow best practices.

**Assistant**: Created a comprehensive `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` file documenting the entire project evolution from inception through various phases:
- Phase 1: Original Game Development
- Phase 2: ChatGPT Classic Version
- Phase 3: NxN Game Addition
- Phase 4: Code Structure and Best Practices
- Phase 5: Visual and Layout Improvements

The documentation includes detailed information about:
- Component organization
- Styling structure
- Testing implementation
- Future enhancement plans

### Conversation Preservation Request

**User**: Could you also preserve the current chat conversation in a file so I can reference this dialog later?

**Assistant**: Created this `CONVERSATION_HISTORY.md` file to preserve our conversation for future reference.
